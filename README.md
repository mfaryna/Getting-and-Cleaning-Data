Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================

To obtain the tidy data set the following steps were taken:

1. Loading data 
Data sets were loaded into R (they must be in your working directory!).

2. Merging data
Merging train and test sets into one data sets (for now as three different variables).

3. Labeling data
Naming activities in a human way.

4. Removing unneccessary variables
Making some memory free.

5. Computing mean and sd for each measurment
For each measurement mean and standard deviation were computed. Each of them as separate list.
Then they were unlisted and binded to one variable measure.

6. Final merging data
Data about subjects, activities and their mean and sd were bined into one variable.

7. Summarizing data
Computing mean and sd of the measurments for each subject and each activity.

8. Creating text file to submit.
